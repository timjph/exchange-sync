Overview
========
Exchange Sync will read data from your Exchange account and export flagged emails (not Exchange tasks) to Remember The Milk, and calendar appointments to Google Calendar. It will not modify data in your Exchange account in any way. Google has a similar service for Windows users called Google Calendar Sync. This application can be considered Google Calendar Sync for Linux and Mac (but will also work on Windows), with the additional Remember The Milk functionality.

Linux Usage Instructions
========================
1. Create a folder in your home directory called exchange-sync.
2. Download the [release jar](https://github.com/gdenning/exchange-sync/releases/download/1.0.3/exchangesync-1.0.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar) to ~/exchange-sync.
3. Download the [sample properties file](https://github.com/gdenning/exchange-sync/releases/download/1.0.3/exchangesync.properties) to the same folder.
4. Modify exchangesync.properties file as follows:
    - Set exchangeHost to the hostname you usually use to access Outlook Web Access.
    - Set exchangeDomain, exchangeUsername, exchangePassword to your Microsoft Exchange domain, username, and password.
    - Set rtmListName to the name of the Remember the Milk list that you want to export tasks to.
    - Set googleCalendarName to the name of the Google Calendar that you want to export appointments to. This should match one of the calendar names under the "My Calendars" list on the left-hand side of your Google Calendar view.
5. Create a symlink to the jar to simplify upgrades: <code>ln -s ~/exchange-sync/exchangesync-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar ~/exchange-sync/exchangesync.jar</code>
6. Add the following line to your /etc/crontab file: <code>*/30 *   * * *   user   java -jar ~/exchange-sync/exchangesync.jar > ~/exchange-sync/exchangesync.log 2>&1</code> (You will need to change "user" to your username.)
